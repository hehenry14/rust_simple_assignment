# Simple Rust assignment

This is a small Rust assignment for me to understand Rust development better. The requirement is and API web server that:

[1]. Does CRUD operation with ORM.
[2]. Join tables.
[3]. Simple recursive datastructure such as binary search tree.
[4]. Try out some design patterns, Factory methods, Iterator and Decorator.

## Database design

It is going to be a simple database. A school have teachers, and teachers have courses, and students attends courses. Design a database base on this.
